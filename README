These are a couple of scripts I use to create a cloud-hosted Fedora
development box with all of the bits and pieces I use on a regular
basis.

Use a boxgrinder meta-appliance with green-devbox.appl to create a
development box appliance as root like so...

$ boxgrinder-build green-devbox.appl -p ec2 -d ebs

Remember to put this in /root/.boxgrinder/config:

plugins:
  ebs:
    access_key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    account_number: AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
    delete_on_termination: false

Also note that you can mount plenty of ephemeral storage on the
boxgrinder meta-appliance like so:

$ mount /dev/xvdb /mnt

The meta-appliances don't have much free storage, so I recommend
building your image in ephemeral storage at /mnt.  Just "cd /mnt"
before running boxgrinder-build as above.
